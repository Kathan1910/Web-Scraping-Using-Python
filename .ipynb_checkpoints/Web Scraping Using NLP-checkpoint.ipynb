      " Nearshoring is an outsourcing model that many companies worldwide have chosen thanks to the perks they get working with a software development company near to them. For others, contracting software services in countries that are more distant than usual (offshoring) is also becoming a smart business alternative in terms of productivity, costs, and competitiveness. I have worked with several Hexacta engineers in the past 5 years, each time with a good result. When it came time for me to make the decision about which firm to engage for a new software company I was helping to build, there was no question about who I wanted to hire. Hexacta has been a true partner for us. The leadership team asked insightful questions about the project’s initial needs and put together the winning proposal. Then they staffed the project with talented engineers who truly care about their work and truly care for the success of this new company. Now, one year later, I can’t imagine working with anyone else. Hexacta has been delivering applications development and application maintenance services to Sodexo for many years. As an application manager, responsible for CorePass, I am very satisfied with services delivered by Hexacta team. The development project undertaken by Hexacta was done by a highly motivated, compatible and empathic team. Thanks to the use of Agile development practices we were able to adapt to the user’s needs within the forecasted timeframe, achieving a great quality product. I value the predisposition of the Hexacta’s team to incorporate these practices and always aim for technical excellence. Our experience with Hexacta was very good, our teams learnt new agile techniques, and people got valuable knowledge for their professional development. Hexacta stands out for its high commitment and compliance with deadlines. Throughout the whole process the team looked for alternatives, gave us advice and above all, always had a great disposition. The quality and professional warmth  of Hexacta’s team made a real difference to the success of the project. It has been an excellent experience. Should an opportunity become available to work with Hexacta in the future, I would welcome it! I really appreciate the reliability, the hard work, the ability to work with the team in Stamford and Hexacta’s technical expertise.
